# GPS Brainstorm tool
The GPS brainstorm kit allows a group of 12 to 15 people to brainstorm in a structured way.

This web application allows you to replace the flipchart part of the method.

More information about the GPS brainstorm kit can be found on [the Flanders DC website](http://www.flandersdc.be/nl/gps).
